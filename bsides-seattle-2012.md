On December 15th I will be giving a 2.5 hour training session at [BSidesSeattle](http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/57847942/BsidesSeattle) on how to use [OWASP ZAP](http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/).

This is a training session, not a talk!  I strongly recommend that you bring a computer that you can use to run ZAP as you will get much more out of it by trying things.  The format for the session will be a series of 15 minute talks about something or other, followed by 15 minutes of testing and QA, which will speed up or slow down based on how many questions people ask.

There will also be a treatement of bugs such as Cross Site Scripting, SQL Injection, and a couple of others, time permitting.

I look forward to seeing everyone on Saturday!
